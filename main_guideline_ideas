                             My concerns with and possible soutions to ownership of traditonal LGBTQ+ Facebook groups.

Definitions
Owner: a person or few people that have full digital control of everything that happens on the Facebook group.


#1 Ownership

- Explanation:
  - A Facebook group is like a digital town square.
  - You can’t simply have 1 or a few people own the entire thing. That is a dictatorship.
    - Furthermore the often ownership needs to be diverse.
  - Diverse ownership
    - Not all people who are friends or will automatically agree with whatever another owner does.
    - Which letter(s) of the LGBTQ+ are they?
    - Age
    - Ethnic background
    - Economic income bracket
    - Education level 
    - Etc






#2 Political structure

- Right now most Facebook groups are owned by just a few people
  - That is a dictatorship
- Picking a better political structure
  - Option 1: Elected representatives/owners
    - Easy to implement
    - Not ideal for many reasons; America is very corrupt. 
      Right now unlimited campaign contributions for politicians from mega corporations and billionaires is 
      considered “free speech” by the Supreme Court.
  - Option 2: Decentralized direct democracy 
    - Every “verified” user owns a piece of the group. Likely a crypto token? This is absolutely not a crypto scam and this will likely not be 
      implemented for a while if at all. I'm thinking something like a Decentralized Autonomous Organization where each person own a share of the group and 
      important things like voting on a preferred venue or banning somebody from the group would need to either a plurality or majority of the votes from each
      active group member (a real democracy).
      - Requires users to manage crypto, which is an unnecessary hardship
      - Perhaps it is feasible to float a queer-coin or GFT (Gay NFT) over Ethereum
    - Maybe something with an expiry date to prevent inactive or bad faith users from participating.
    - Ideas/venues/choices are voted on directly using a poll or app
      - Must use rank-choice voting.
      - Can anonymous google forms work?
  - Option 3: Special interest groups
    - Similar to option 1 but requires subcommunities to manage themselves
    - Each subcommunity can govern as they wish and submit representatives for a gay congress
    - hard to manage in practice--how do we acheive a consistent global governance?




                                            Ideas to make LGBTQ+ meetups better



A note on language

Demographics: 

- At minimum: capture age and LGBTQ+ status
- LGBTQ+ identity 
  - i.e. Gay man, lesbian, Bisexual, Trans man, Trans woman, Asexual, Intersex, gender fluid, etc.
- Age
  - Or estimated age, or age bracket
- Ethnic background
  - Ethnic background i.e. Race
    - Race is kind of an outdated concept but you get what I mean
- Occupation 
  - A note on occupation 
    - Occupation is a good indicator of how much free time somebody (especially newcomers or lonely people) have to hang out. 
      Which tells you who to pair them up with if they want to make local friends.
- Military 
- Student 
  - Part time or full time?
  - Do they also work?
- Regular job
  - Do they work part time, or 60 hours a week?
- Responsibilities
  - Are they super busy with something else?
    - Work
    - School 
    - Family
    - Something else




Assumptions:

- Note: If peope don’t agree on these assumptions, then a lot of the information below is void.
- We want the meetup to be inclusive 
  - i.e. friendly and enjoyable for every letter of the Alphabet Mafia (LGBTQIA+)
  - Do people from every letter really want to hang out together?
    - For example there’s a reason there used to be “gay bars” and “lesbian bars”.
- We want newcomers to your local area to feel welcome, make friends, find a partner, etc.
  - But it would not be terrible if the meetup group becomes solely a place to find a hookup. 
    That’s what Grindr and other dating apps are for.
  - We could be providing community resources to make the dating experience safer, better structured, and less daunting


              How to run and improve Meetups

- Increase attendance in general
  - Make it possible for people to find your group.
    - Put the group/page/whatever on meetup.com, they have good Search Engine Optimisation (SEO).
  - Make newcomers return
    - Have an anonymous suggestion or feedback box or link where people can express their true feelings without being judged.
    - #0 understand why people add themselves to the group  / show up to an initial meetup in the first place.
      - My theory
        - The reason newcomers show up to the meetup is to make friends, find a partner, find a hookup, or are
          first coming out and just want to dip their feet in.
    - #1 find out why they don’t return
      - Online
        - Do a Facebook poll targeting newcomers
          - Repost it every day so people get a chance to see it
          - Run it for 1 week
          - Look through the Facebook group member list and specifically send the poll to the last 10-25% of members to add.
    - Collect as much data as possible
    - Possible reasons newcomers don't return
      - Venue is too hard to get to (cost or time wise)
        - Solution: Venue change
          - Compute the average location of each community member and find a good spot near there.
      - They don’t like the venue. Ask why.
    - In Person
      - Ask each newcomer how they found out about our meetup
        - Ie meetup.com, Facebook, a personal recommendation, or other.
      - If they aren’t a member of the Facebook group maybe ask them to join?
    - Write down the name and email of each newcomer every meetup
    - Find them on Facebook and reach out to them to ask why they don’t feel like returning (be super nice about, don’t pressure them to return)
    - Be sure to write down in a google doc each person, their socials (if possible), their demographics, how many times they have attended.

  - #2 Make people want to come back
    - Make it easy to identify us in the venue
      - Put a few rainbow flags up
    - Be nice to them
    - Avoid forming cliques
    - Hand out a flyer
      - Include all the links and or a QR code for the Facebook page
      - Include the times and location of any possible monthly venue change
        - For example maybe one night per week you commission a local bar to use their space
    - Maybe ask them to add our weekly meetup to their calendar? Or setup event notifications on Facebook.
    - Introduce them to many people. Especially the group organizers, people of their same demographic, and other newcomers.
      - Make sure to tell them it’s okay if they don’t remember everyone’s name at first.
      - An east solution would be nametags.
    - Play social games with them
      - Note: Social games allow people to have fun and get to know each other while avoiding the awkwardness of a direct conversation. Most newcomers show up intimidated and nervous especially if they haven’t had a drink yet or don’t drink.
      - The social game must be short enough for somebody to play and still have plenty of time to socialize individually or repeat the game with more or less participants.
      - Drawing games 
        - Hang man
      - Certain card or board games
        - {The And} card game friends or strangers edition is a personal favorite.
        - Other social card games
        - Some board game that’s easy to learn and isn’t mentally taxing so much they have no time to talk.
    - Engage in a weekly conversation topic
      - Take turns with everyone or otherwise allow/encourage everyone to engage.
